# Lecture 03 – Backend Setup, Dependencies & Versioning

## Backend First Approach
- We start by creating the **backend folder first**
- Backend logic is developed before frontend
- Helps in clean architecture and separation of concerns

---

## Backend Setup Steps
- Create a `backend` folder
- Initialize Node.js project inside backend
- Create a `src` folder for source code
- Entry point will be inside `src`

---

## Node Project Initialization
- We run `npm init`
- This generates:
  - `package.json`
  - `package-lock.json`

---

## package.json
- Configuration file for the Node project
- Contains:
  - Project metadata (name, version, description)
  - Dependencies
  - Scripts

---

## package-lock.json
- Stores **exact versions** of installed dependencies
- Ensures same dependency versions across all machines
- Prevents “works on my machine” issues
- Should always be committed to Git

---

## Express.js
- Express is used to create the backend server
- It is a lightweight and fast Node.js framework
- Industry standard for backend development

---

## What is a Dependency?
- A dependency is an external library
- Our project depends on it to work properly
- Installed dependencies are stored inside `node_modules`
- Dependency details are mentioned in `package.json`

---

## Dependency Types
- **Dependencies** → required for application to run
- **Dev Dependencies** → required only during development

---

## Semantic Versioning (Why 3 Digits?)

Example version:4.18.2
      
- **Major** → Breaking changes
- **Minor** → New features (backward compatible)
- **Patch** → Bug fixes

---

## Caret (^) and Tilde (~)

### Caret (^)
- Allows minor and patch updates
- Major version remains fixed

### Tilde (~)
- Allows only patch updates
- Minor and major versions remain fixed

### No Symbol
- Exact version is installed
- No automatic updates

---

## Why Versions Matter
- Prevents unexpected breaking changes
- Ensures stability across environments
- Helps in controlled upgrades

---

## Creating Our Own Server
- Server will be created using Express
- Server entry file will be inside `src`
- Actual server code is written later

---

## Nodemon
- Nodemon is a development tool
- Automatically restarts the server on file changes
- Saves time during development

---

## Nodemon as Dev Dependency
- Used only in development
- Not needed in production
- Keeps production build lightweight

---

## Key Takeaways
- Backend setup is done before coding features
- `package.json` manages project configuration
- `package-lock.json` ensures consistency
- Dependencies power modern applications
- Semantic versioning avoids breaking updates
- Nodemon improves developer experience

## 🔥 One-Line Summary
Lecture 3 focuses on setting up the backend foundation, understanding dependencies, versioning, and improving development workflow without writing server logic.
